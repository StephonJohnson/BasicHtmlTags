    <h1>My Love For Animals</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>I consider myself to be one of the biggest animal lovers on the planet.
        While my knowledge for wild animals is generic and surface level,
        it is the area of domestic animals where my knowledge
        and love deepens and broadens, and there are many that can be domesticated:</p>

        <h4>A Few Animals That Can Be Domesticated</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>horses</li>
            <li>mice</li>
            <li>cats</li>
            <li>dogs</li>
            <li>ferrets</li>


        </ul>

        <p>Some animals can be pets, but not necessarily domesticated. Here are a few:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>snakes</li>
                <li>lizards</li>
                <li>mongooses</li>
                <li>hedgehogs</li>
            </ul>


        <br/>

      <p> Dogs have been my favorite animal pretty much since I have been alive. 
        My grandparents owned a dog named Puddles, and upon my summer visits with them,
        I spent a vast majority of my time with him(Puddles).</p>
        
        <br/>

    <p>My favorite breed of dog is by far is the pitbull terrier. I mean,
        how could you NOT love that smile!?!?!?</p>
